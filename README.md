# hello-world
hello everyone,
myname is destiny and i am a prudent programmer and problem-solver. No one has ever taught me programming.
And just as no one taught me how to eat. I believe no one should teach me programmming before i master it. So just as we all noticed ourselves eating without any instructor so also i discovered myself programming without any instructor.

Note: i say no instructor , i didn't say no textbooks or researches.
